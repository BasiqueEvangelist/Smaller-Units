# Smaller-Units
A rewrite of little blocks

# Info
I should probably note that I did not use code from the original mod

I have no plans to backport to anything from 1.12.2 or lower, but I might do a rewrite of the 1.12 version, as thereâ€™s still a ton of mods that have not portrd and I had made a bad version of su there

# Fact And Question: 

(Questions I see people asking)

**Will this be better than little blocks?**

No.

**Can I use this in my modpacks?**

Yes, that is why I post mods to curse forge.

**Is there somewhere I can talk to the dev(s) in realtime?**

Yes, https://discord.gg/qFEBSsm

**Why not just wait for someone else to port it or let slimevoid do it themselves?**

A) I realized nobody else was gonna port it

B) Slimevoid seems to have fallen appart
